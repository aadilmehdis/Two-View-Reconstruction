% ALGEBRAICTRIANGULATION  Takes in two sets of correspondences x1, x2, each
% of size 3-by-N (homogeneous image coordinates). Also takes in the
% corresponding 3 x 4 projection matrices P1 and P2. Outputs the
% triangulated 3D points. Does 'vanilla' algebraic triangulation. The
% output points are in 3D homogeneous coordinates, i.e., the output matrix
% is 4 x N.


% Check if number of matches is consistent
if size(x1, 2) ~= size(x2, 2)
    error('x1 and x2 must have the same number of image points.');
end

if size(x1,1) ~= 3 || size(x2,1) ~= 3
    error('x1 and x2 must be homogeneous image coordinates');
